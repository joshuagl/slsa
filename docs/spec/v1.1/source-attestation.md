title: Source Attestations
description: Description of the SLSA source attestation specification for verifying how source code is managed.
layout: standard
---
This document describes the project metadata necessary to represent which SLSA
Source level a project satisfies, if any.

## Purpose

Describe how a project manages its source code so that:

-   Consumers of the source can determine its authenticity.
-   Consumers of the project can assess its maturity and fitness for use.

## Model

A SLSA Source attestation asserts that a project follows certain practices
pertaining to its source code. Attestations are scoped to a project as a whole
and generated when creating a complete copy of that project's source. For
example, a project may produce a source attestation when exporting its source
for distribution or when a build pipeline fetches the source.

## Provenance generation

Attestations for Source L2+ SHOULD be generated by the trusted source control
platform. Alternatively, other authorized parties MAY generate L2+ attestations
using APIs provided by the source control platform.

The Source track follows the same provenance generation requirements as the
Build track. Please see
[Provenance generation](requirements#provenance-generation) for details.

## Schema

| Field | Type | Required at Level | Description
| --- | --- | --- | ---
| `projectID` | string | L1+ | Immutable project ID. For example, the SLSA Specification's project ID is `www.github.com/slsa-framework/slsa`.
| `revisionID` | string | L1+ | Immutable revision ID. In git terminology, this is the commit hash.
| `digest` | string | L1+ | Digest of the source. In git terminology, this is the repo's tree hash.
| `timestamp` | string | L2+ | ISO 8601 representation of the time at which the source control platform generated the attestation. This timestamp MUST be determined by the platform.
| `2FA` | FeatureHistory | L2+ | Whether 2FA was enabled for this project.
| `historyRetained` | FeatureHistory | L2+ | Whether this project retains its version history.
| `codeReview` | FeatureHistory | L3+ | Whether this project requires code review.
| `differentPersons` | FeatureHistory | L3+ | Whether this project has a different persons policy.

### FeatureHistory

| Field | Type | Description
| --- | --- | ---
| `enabled` | boolean | If true, then the feature was enabled at the time of attestation generation.
| `since` | string | ISO 8601 representation of the timestamp at which the feature was last enabled.

## Verification

Verification MUST include the following steps:

1.  Ensure the source control platform is one of those in the verifier's preconfigured root of trust.
2.  Verify the signature on the attestation envelope.
3.  Ensure the values for `projectID`, `revisionID`, and `digest` match the expected values.
4.  Determine SLSA Source level.

Note: Although there is no requirement that a project maintain a certain Source
level for any period of time, it is RECOMMENDED that consumers enforce policies
about how long a project maintains its Source level. For example, a consumer
might only consume source that never decreases in Source level. That consumer
could do so by comparing relevant `FeatureHistory.since` fields to an expected
value.

### Determining Source level

Use the following procedure to determine the Soure level the attestation is asserting.

```pseudocode
def getSourceLevel(attestation):
  bool meetsL2 = attestation.timestamp
    AND attestation.2FA.enabled
    AND (attestation.2FA.since < attestation.timestamp)
  bool meetsL3 = meetsL2
    AND (attestation.codeReview.enabled
         AND (attestation.codeReview.since < attestation.timestamp))
    AND (attestation.differentPersons
         AND (attestation.differentPersons.since < attestation.timestamp))

  if meetsL3:
    return SLSA_SOURCE_L3
  else if meetsL2:
    return SLSA_SOURCE_L2
  return SLSA_SOURCE_L1
```
