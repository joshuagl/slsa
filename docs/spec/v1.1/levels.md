SLSA is organized into a series of levels that provide increasing supply chain
security guarantees. This gives you confidence that software hasn’t been
tampered with and can be securely traced back to its source.

This page is a descriptive overview of the SLSA levels and tracks, describing
their intent. For the prescriptive requirements for each level, see
[Requirements](requirements.md). For a general overview of SLSA, see
[About SLSA](principles.md).

## Levels and tracks

SLSA levels are split into *tracks*. Each track has its own set of levels that
measure a particular aspect of supply chain security. The purpose of tracks is
to recognize progress made in one aspect of security without blocking on an
unrelated aspect. Tracks also allow the SLSA spec to evolve: we can add more
tracks without invalidating previous levels.

| Track/Level | Requirements | Focus
| ----------- | ------------ | -----
| [Build L0]  | (none)       | (n/a)
| [Build L1]  | Provenance showing how the package was built | Mistakes, documentation
| [Build L2]  | Signed provenance, generated by a hosted build platform | Tampering after the build
| [Build L3]  | Hardened build platform | Tampering during the build
| [Source L0] | (none) | (n/a)
| [Source L1] | Version control | Basic project hygiene
| [Source L2] | Strong authentication, Retained history, Verified timestamps | Change attribution
| [Source L3] | Code review, Different persons | Change authorization

<!-- For comparison: a future Build L4's focus might be reproducibility or
hermeticity or completeness of provenance -->

> Note: The [previous version] of the specification used a single unnamed track,
> SLSA 1–4. For version 1.0 the Source aspects were removed to focus on the
> Build track. A Source track may be added in [future versions].

## Build track

The SLSA build track describes increasing levels of trustworthiness and
completeness in a package artifact's <dfn>provenance</dfn>. Provenance describes
what entity built the artifact, what process they used, and what the inputs
were. The lowest level only requires the provenance to exist, while higher
levels provide increasing protection against tampering of the build, the
provenance, or the artifact.

The primary purpose of the build track is to enable [verification] that the
artifact was built as expected. Consumers have some way of knowing what the
expected provenance should look like for a given package and then compare each
package artifact's actual provenance to those expectations. Doing so prevents
several classes of [supply chain threats](threats.md).

Each ecosystem (for open source) or organization (for closed source) defines
exactly how this is implemented, including: means of defining expectations, what
provenance format is accepted, whether reproducible builds are used, how
provenance is distributed, when verification happens, and what happens on
failure. Guidelines for implementers can be found in the
[requirements](requirements.md).

### Build L0: No guarantees

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

No requirements---L0 represents the lack of SLSA.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Development or test builds of software that are built and run on the same
machine, such as unit tests.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

n/a

<dt>Benefits<dd>

n/a

</dl>
</section>
<section id="build-l1">

### Build L1: Provenance exists

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Package has provenance showing how it was built. Can be used to prevent mistakes
but is trivial to bypass or forge.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations wanting to easily and quickly gain some benefits of
SLSA---other than tamper protection---without changing their build workflows.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

-   Software Producer:
    -   Follow a consistent build process so that others can form
        expectations about what a "correct" build looks like.
    -   Run builds on a build platform that meets Build L1 requirements.
    -   Distribute provenance to consumers, preferably using a convention
        determined by the package ecosystem.
-   Build platform:
    -   Automatically generate [provenance] describing how the artifact was
        built, including: what entity built the package, what build process
        they used, and what the top-level input to the build were.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

-   Makes it easier for both producers and consumers to debug, patch, rebuild,
    and/or analyze the software by knowing its precise source version and build
    process.

-   With [verification], prevents mistakes during the release process, such as
    building from a commit that is not present in the upstream repo.

-   Aids organizations in creating an inventory of software and build platforms
    used across a variety of teams.

<dt>Notes<dd>

-   Provenance may be incomplete and/or unsigned at L1. Higher levels require
    more complete and trustworthy provenance.

</dl>

</section>
<section id="build-l2">

### Build L2: Hosted build platform

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Forging the provenance or evading verification requires an explicit "attack",
though this may be easy to perform. Deters unsophisticated adversaries or those
who face legal or financial risk.

In practice, this means that builds run on a hosted platform that generates and
signs[^sign] the provenance.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Projects and organizations wanting to gain moderate security benefits of SLSA by
switching to a hosted build platform, while waiting for changes to the build
platform itself required by [Build L3].

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L1], plus:

-   Software producer:
    -   Run builds on a [hosted] build platform that meets Build L2
        requirements.
-   Build platform:
    -   Generate and sign[^sign] the provenance itself. This may be done
        during the original build, an after-the-fact reproducible build, or
        some equivalent system that ensures the trustworthiness of the
        provenance.
-   Consumer:
    -   Validate the authenticity of the provenance.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

All of [Build L1], plus:

-   Prevents tampering after the build through digital signatures[^sign].

-   Deters adversaries who face legal or financial risk by evading security
    controls, such as employees who face risk of getting fired.

-   Reduces attack surface by limiting builds to specific build platforms that
    can be audited and hardened.

-   Allows large-scale migration of teams to supported build platforms early
    while further hardening work ([Build L3]) is done in parallel.

</dl>
</section>
<section id="build-l3">

[^sign]: Alternate means of verifying the authenticity of the provenance are
    also acceptable.

### Build L3: Hardened builds

<dl class="as-table">
<dt>Summary<dd>

Forging the provenance or evading verification requires exploiting a
vulnerability that is beyond the capabilities of most adversaries.

In practice, this means that builds run on a hardened build platform that offers
strong tamper protection.

<dt>Intended for<dd>

Most software releases. Build L3 usually requires significant changes to
existing build platforms.

<dt>Requirements<dd>

All of [Build L2], plus:

-   Software producer:
    -   Run builds on a hosted build platform that meets Build L3
        requirements.
-   Build platform:
    -   Implement strong controls to:
        -   prevent runs from influencing one another, even within the same
            project.
        -   prevent secret material used to sign the provenance from being
            accessible to the user-defined build steps.

<dt>Benefits<dd>

All of [Build L2], plus:

-   Prevents tampering during the build---by insider threats, compromised
    credentials, or other tenants.

-   Greatly reduces the impact of compromised package upload credentials by
    requiring attacker to perform a difficult exploit of the build process.

-   Provides strong confidence that the package was built from the official
    source and build process.

### Source L0: No guarantees
<dl class="as-table">
<dt> Summary <dd>
L0 represents the lack of a Source level. Projects are L0 by definition before adopting SLSA.

<dt> Intended for <dd>
Experimental Projects, or other Projects early in their lifecycle.

<dt> Requirements <dd>
N/A

<dt> Benefits <dd>
N/A

</dl>

### Source L1: Version controlled
<dl class="as-table">
<dt> Summary <dd>
The project source is stored and managed through a modern version control system.

<dt> Intended for <dd>
Organizations that are unwilling or unable to host their source on a version control platform. If possible, skip to Level 2.

<dt> Requirements <dd>

**[Version controlled]** Every change to the source is tracked in a version control system that meets the following requirements

-  **[Change history]** There exists a record of the history of changes that went into the revision. Each change MUST contain: 
    -  The immutable reference to the new revision
    -  The identities of the uploader, reviewers (if any), and submitter/merger (if different to the uploader)
    -  Timestamps of the reviews (if any) and submission
    -  The change description/justification
    -  The content of the change
    -  The parent revisions.

-  **[Immutable reference]** There exists a way to indefinitely reference this particular, immutable revision. This is usually {project identifier + revision ID}. When the revision ID is a digest of the revision, as in git, nothing more is needed. When the revision ID is a number or otherwise not a digest, then the project server MUST guarantee the immutability of the reference.

<dt> Notes <dd>
Most popular version control systems meet these requirement, such as git, Subversion, Mercurial, and Perforce.

<dt> Benefits <dd>
Version control is a software development best practice, and discussing its benefits is beyond the scope of this page.
</dl>

### Source L2: Verified history
<dl class="as-table">
<dt> Summary <dd>
The project is stored and managed through a source control platform that ensures the change history's integrity.. 

<dt> Intended for <dd>
Organizations that are unwilling or unable to incorporate code review into their software development practices.

<dt> Requirements <dd>

**[Strong authentication]** User accounts that can modify the source or the project's configuration must use two-factor authentication or its equivalent.

**[Verified timestamps]** Each entry in the change history must contain at least one timestamp that is determined by the source control platform and cannot be modified by clients. It MUST be clear in the change history which timestamps are determined by the source control platform.

**[Retained history]** The change history MUST be preserved as long as the source is hosted on the source control system. The source MAY migrate to another source control system, but the organization MUST retain the change history if possible. It MUST NOT be possible for persons to delete or modify the change history, even with multi-party approval, except by trusted platform admins following an established deletion policy. 

<dt> Benefits <dd>
Attributes changes in the version history to specific actors and timestamps, which allows for post-auditing, incident response, and deterrence for bad actors.

</dl>

### Source L3: Changes are authorized
<dl class="as-table">
<dt> Summary <dd>
All changes to the source are approved by two trusted persons prior to submission.

<dt> Intended for <dd>
Enterprise projects and mature open source projects.

<dt> Requirements <dd>

**[Code review]** All changes to the source are approved by two trusted persons prior to submission. User accounts that can perform code reviews MUST use two-factor authentication or its equivalent.   
The following combinations are acceptable:

-  Contributor and reviewer are two different trusted persons.
-  Two different reviewers are trusted persons.

The code review system must meet the following requirements: 

-  **[Informed review]** The reviewer is able and encouraged to make an informed decision about what they're approving. The reviewer MUST be presented with a full, meaningful content diff between the proposed revision and the previously reviewed revision. For example, it is not sufficient to just indicate that a file changed without showing the contents.
-  **[Context-specific approvals]** Approvals are for a specific context, such as a repo + target branch + revision in git. Moving fully reviewed content from one context to another still requires review. (Exact definition of "context" depends on the project, and this does not preclude well-understood automatic or reviewless merges, such as cutting a release branch.) Git example: If a fully reviewed commit in one repo is merged into a different repo, or a commit in one branch is merged into a different branch, then the merge still requires review.
-  **[Atomic change sets]** Changes are recorded in the change history as a single revision that consists of the net delta between the proposed revision and the parent revision. In the case of a nonlinear version control system, where a revision can have more than one parent, the diff must be against the "first common parent" between the parents. In other words, when a feature branch is merged back into the main branch, only the merge itself is in scope.

Trusted robots MAY be exempted from the code review process. It is RECOMMENDED that trusted robots so exempted be run only software built at Build L3+ from sources that meet Source L3.

**[Different persons]** The organization strives to ensure that no two user accounts correspond to the same person. Should the organization discover that it issued multiple accounts to the same person, it MUST act to rectify the situation. For example, it might revoke project privileges for all but one of the accounts and perform retroactive code reviews on any changes where that person's accounts are the author and/or code reviewer(s).

<dt> Benefits <dd>
A compromise of a single human or account does not result in compromise of the project, since all changes require review from two humans.
